# PF2e Athletics Automation Pack

A lightweight Foundry VTT module that adds **single-target Athletics action macros** for the Pathfinder 2e system.

These macros streamline common combat maneuvers by handling the roll and applying the correct effects where possible.

✅ **Trip**  
- Rolls Athletics vs Reflex DC  
- Applies **Prone** on success

✅ **Grapple**  
- Rolls Athletics vs Fortitude DC  
- Applies **Grabbed** or **Restrained** on critical success

✅ **Shove**  
- Rolls Athletics vs Fortitude DC  
- Provides a reminder for push distance (manual movement)

✅ **Reposition**  
- Rolls Athletics vs Fortitude DC  
- Provides a reminder for forced movement distance (manual movement)

✅ **Disarm**

## Usage

1. Install and enable the module
2. Open:

   **Compendium Packs → Athletics Macros**

4. In play:

   - Select your token  
   - Target exactly **one** creature  
   - Click the macro

The roll dialog will appear automatically.

## Requirements

This module depends on:

- **Foundry Virtual Tabletop v12+**
- **Pathfinder Second Edition system**
- **xdy-pf2e-workbench** (required for automation helpers)

Make sure Workbench is installed and enabled or the macros will fail.

---

## Notes / Limitations

- Forced movement (Shove/Reposition) must still be performed manually
- Disarm in PF2e does not automatically remove weapons, so this macro only explains the outcome
- These macros are intended for fast single-target combat actions, not full battlefield automation
